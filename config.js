Showcased the home's crown jewels through professional photography and video tours that highlighted the extensive landscaping, sparkling pool, and beautifully renovated kitchen. Launched targeted digital advertising campaigns that reached qualified buyers both locally and from out-of-town markets. Created urgency by emphasizing the property's rare features: 5 spacious bedrooms, soaring ceilings uncommon in the area, and resort-style outdoor living spaces. Orchestrated strategic open houses that attracted serious, pre-qualified buyers rather than casual lookers"
